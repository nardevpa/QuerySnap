logoff.exe is a legitimate executable file associated with Microsoft Windows, specifically version 10.0.15063.0, and is primarily responsible for logging users off the system. As a component of the Windows operating system, it is considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware. However, users may occasionally encounter errors related to logoff.exe, which can manifest as issues during the logoff process or unexpected shutdowns. Despite its safety, it is essential for users to ensure that the logoff.exe file is located in the correct directory (typically within the System32 folder) to avoid potential security threats, as malware can sometimes disguise itself with similar filenames.
