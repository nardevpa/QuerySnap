Given its official status, lsm.exe is generally considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware. However, users may encounter errors related to this file, which can arise from issues such as corruption, malware disguising itself with the same name, or system misconfigurations.

Regular system scans and maintaining updated antivirus software can help mitigate risks associated with malicious variants.
